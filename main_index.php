          Generally, a placement committee member would have to deal with the following obstacles:
          Calling and mailing hundreds of HRs who usually don't have the time nor the ability to bring in their companies for placement. The ones who do, are usually higher on the ladder and aren't as approachable.
          Handling hundreds of frustrated students who aren't getting the specific company of their choice or even a single job.
          Coordinating with unhelpful faculty who poke their nose into relatively easier matters and stay out of the toughies.
